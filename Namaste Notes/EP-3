--> we create a script to build a production ready app --> creating a script to
start a project in production --> we created a script in package.json to run our
project instead of using npx parcel index.html --> We wrote start script in
package.json the in cmd "npm run start" (start is the name which we gave in
script) or use "npm start" but "npm build" wont work --> React element is an
OBJECT --> //JSX JSX is a js syntax which is easier to create react elements -->
JSX is not an HTML in js --> JSX is like HTML or XML --> jsx is not proper js
(if we try to run in browser's console we will get an error) --> jsx (transpiled
before it reaches the JS engine) - parcel - babel --> JSX => babel transpiles it
to React.createElement => ReactElement -JS object =>HTMLElement(render) --> In
html we use class as our attribute but in JSX we have to use "className" jsx
needs camel letter --> if we want to write a code in multiple lines in JSX "()"
is mandatory -->
