# react framework

--> react is faster/efficient at dom manipulation

# Hooks

--> react hook is a normal js function which is given to react
--> hook is a powerful variable which differs it from normal js variable
--> Two important react hook
---> useState() - superpowerful state variabless in react
---> useEffect()
--> whenever a state variable changes, react will rerender the component

# Reconciliation, Virtual DOM, Diff Algorithm

--> Reconciliation(also known as react fiber)

--> Virtual DOM is a representation of actual DOM

--> Diff algorithm finds out the difference between two virtual DOM

# why react is fast

--> react is efficient at DOM manipulation. How? because it has virtual DOM
--> React can efficiently find out the differences between virtual DOM and update the UI
